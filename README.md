# SILVIA project
Modeling the synthesis of SILica materials VIA multiscale computer simulation project. 
This is a silica reative model (__RSi__), based on the MARTINI (Coarse-Grained) Forcefield, that uses a new paradigm for Molecular Dynamics bonding that I developed when I was messing around with Lennard-Jones potentials. This new reative bonding model enables the simulation of silica condensation, and formation of silica mesophases in the presence of surfactants in aqueous solutions with excelent agreement with experimental conditions. There are tons of configurations that you can make, so you can change bead parameters for charge anisotropy and even pH. 

__This was tested for silica but this reative model can be applied to any chemical specie and any MD package that uses Lennard-Jones potentials (basically all... Amber, LAMMPS, GROMACS, etc...). This model was also tested (initial prototype) for all atom simulations of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) (link for the video bellow) and proteins with GROMACS.__

Details of the final form of the mesophase, with the bigger silica chains highlighted in pink.

The forcefield is hidden, becaus a scientific paper is yet to be published.
